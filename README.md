# Script for visualizing the format table

First, download as "Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)". The script will assume that this results in the existance of the file `./High-Level Format Compatibility.xlsx` and allow the script to be executed like this:

```shell
./list2dot.py
```

This results in the creation of a [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language))-formated file `list2dot.gv` and a PDF rendering of it `list2dot.gv.pdf`.
